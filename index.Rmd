## Overview

* The **Meteorite Landings** application can be accessed via https://aldredes.shinyapps.io/meteors/.  
* This shiny application basically shows the map of known meteorite landings around the world since year 301 until 2013 A.D. based on the comprehensive dataset from The Meteoritical Society.  
* The map is rendered using **leaflet**, and the graph is built with **plotly**.
* The dataset can be downloaded from https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh.

## The Dataset

The data was made tidy using an R script by:

* removing all rows with no year and geolocation data;
* removing all rows with year beyond the current year;
* removing all rows with geolocation `(0, 0)`; 
* creating a new columns `countryName` and `iso2` to get the country and its corresponding official ISO 2 alpha country code from the map boundaries based on `getMap()` function of `rworldmap` library; and 
* creating a new column `wmk2006Class` derived from `recclass` column based on the _Weissberg-McCoy-Krot (2006) scheme_ *

## The Dataset

Below is the summary of data *:

```{r load_data, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(data.table))
meteors <- fread("data/nasa_meteors_scrubbed.csv", na.strings = c("NA", "#DIV/0!", ""), header = TRUE)
meteors$recclass <- as.factor(meteors$recclass)
meteors$wmk2006Class <- as.factor(meteors$wmk2006Class)
meteors$countryName <- as.factor(meteors$countryName)
meteors$iso2 <- as.factor(meteors$iso2)
summary(meteors)
```

<small> * `NA`'s in the `countryName` and `iso2` means no country was retrieved from the function and probably points to a body of water on earth. </small>

## User Interface / Features

* To make the application simpler, we limit the filtering elements and user inputs.  The user can filter the data by **year**, and **classifications** according to _Weissberg-McCoy-Krot (2006) scheme_. 
* Additional features include a **plot** of counts by year, a selection to change the **map tile provider**, and an option to change the **map information display**.
* The choropleth map was built using the spatial data from a _key markup language (KML)_ file * to set the boundaries among countries.
<small> * The said KML file can be retrieved from https://community.qlik.com/docs/DOC-7295 and it's last updated in 2014. </small>
* Progress bar is also shown when loading information on the map.  _(The loading of map elements depend on the response from the shiny server, and sometimes it takes ~5secs to load the updated elements.)_
